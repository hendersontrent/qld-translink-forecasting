# qld-translink-forecasting
This projects aims to see if a forecasting tool can be built on TransLink data.

## Motivation

The Queensland Government open-sources a substantial amount of transit information. This information is quite detailed and is available in a time-series format. This drives the following questions:

* What are the trends, seasons, and cycles, if any?
* Can this data be forecast?
* What is the best forecasting method?
* Do regional or operational variables matter?

## Output

Statistical forecast models and accompanying data visualisations.

## Data source

All data was sourced from https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/go-card-transaction-data
